# Allan's keyboard
### About:
A 75% keyboard with a custom case. All parts under $150 USD, uses screw in stabilisers and akko v3 yellow switches along with M3 heatset inserts and screws. I made this project to learn more about CAD and making hardware projects. I thought it would be a reasonable next step after a macropad (was way harder actually) however I got to challenge myself and learn new things. 


### Case:

The case was made in Fusion 360 and features a gap in the middle (R.I.P. sound but I wear headphones anyways) and an open honeycomb pattern on the base (even worse for sound !!!!!!)

### Firmware:

The firmware was made with KMK however I intend to recreate firmware in ZMK for full bluetooth capabilities( I am currently learning as I don't want to just copilot/vibecode everything)
