##June 9: research and getting started

So this is my first time making a keyboard, so I decided to do some thorough research to make sure that I fully understood everything, and made it how I wanted. 
I'm thinking of a 75% keyboard, specificaly something similar to Epomakers, minus the rotary encoder.

##June 10: starting the pcb

I started off by creating my design in Keyboard Layout Editor, then spent time trying to import it into KiCad.

Took a really long time, I kept having problems with using the keboard placer plugin in Kicad, 
had to redo footprints a bunch, set annotations and rearrange my schematic.

Only have to move all diodes and route traces

Update: closed the window and clicked discard change because I was sure i only made one small thing. Will be restarting but oh well. 

*Total time spent: 180 mins*

##june 11: Fixing and continuing the pcb

Finished positioning everything and routing all the traces. (made sure to save this time)
